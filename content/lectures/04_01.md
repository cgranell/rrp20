Practices
===

Repeat until a task's is done:

#1 Write scientific articles  

#2 Show your work for different audiences


#1 Write scientific articles
===
incremental: true

For writing a paper...
- Do you use a word processor? 
- Do you use web-based collaborative writing platform?  
- Do you use _Markdown_???

Traditional paper is a piece separated from code and data

Reproducible notebooks are closer to the idea of (interactive) scientific papers. 
- mix narrative with data & code
- weak support of features in scientific writing (reference management, etc)

Why not to use markdown to write scientific papers?

Tools for collaborative writing:

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): Latex
[Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/): Latex/markdown & code
[Manuscripts.io](https://www.manuscripts.io/): Latex/markdown & code
[Manubot](https://manubot.org/): markdown and code

Same workflow (-> routine, habit)

- Write in markdown
- Convert it into a `.html`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` document

Difference with R Markdown (notebooks) is a extended header section (metadata between `---` and `---` )
