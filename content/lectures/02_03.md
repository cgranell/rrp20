Practices
===

#1 Create the project folder

#2 Create a (local) version control repository (__git__)

#3 Connect the local repository to a remote repository (__github__)
 
#4 Add a README file 

#5 Add a LICENSE file


#1 Create the project folder 
===

Remember: one folder = one project

What's a project? 
- one experiment, 
- your ideas for future research,
- regular meeting notes/minutes 
- a review paper, conference presentations
- a book, teaching materials
- PhD thesis manuscript 
  
#1 Create the project folder 
===

Based on the [folder template](https://github.com/cgranell/rr-template):

- Star with a limited number of folders depending on the type of project
  - eg experiment: `data-raw` + `data` + `R` + `notes`
  - eg book: `doc` + `notes`

- Create new subfolders hierarchically as needed
  - eg: `data/spain`, `data/europe` 

- Include README files to describe metadata/complex content of subfolders


#2 Create a local version control repository 
===

Turn your project folder into a __local version control repository__ to track changes on your work 

After installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer, you can either: 
- type sequence of commands in command-line interfaces (eg. commad prompt, shell)
- graphical interfaces integrated in your favorite development environment (eg. RStudio)

Dozens of resources by _googling_ [introduction to git](https://www.google.com/search?q=introduction+to+git)


#3 Connect local repository to a remote repository
===

**Sync** your local repository to a remote, collaborative code reposor

If you work alone on a project, it's not necessary but recommended

If you work with others on the same projec, it's a must

My workflow: 
- Instead of command line interfaces, I [use git with RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077)
- Create a remote repository in GitHub 
- Create a (local) project by cloning the remote Git repository


#4 Add a README file 
===

Include a __README__ file in the root folder to describe the project, provide basic orientation to use the scritps, data, etc. 

Written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) markup language (later on Sessions 04 and 05)

Automatically visualised when landing on a GitHub repository
- eg. [folder template](https://github.com/cgranell/rr-template)
- eg. [review paper](https://github.com/cgranell/apps-mental-disorders-jmir)


#5 Add a LICENSE file
===

A license is a contract between the authors and the users. Without a license, **copyright** is automatically attached to your work 

**Always add a license** ([file](https://github.com/cgranell/rr-template/blob/master/LICENCE)) to software you plan to make public:
 - Permissive = attribution (recomended for academic work)
 - Copyleft = share-alike (same license as the original)
