A simple reproducible project workflow
===

***

- Intermediate workflow
  - 03: RRP - Iterative workflow


Practices
===

#1 Use Markdown as text format 

#3 Write computational notebooks 


#1 Use Markdown as text format
===

You will need to document your project by writing :

- One README file (_always!_)
- One or more README files in other subfolders (_if required_)
- project rationale and notes in folder `notes`
- scientific articles in folder `doc`
- computational notebooks in folder `reports`
- books, slides, dashboards, etc.

How many formats and tools do you need?

#1 Use Markdown as text format 
===

**Markdown** can be used for everything!! 

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a lightweight markup language to add formatting elements to plain text documents

These resources are a good starting point:
- [Markdown basic syntax reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
- [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

#2 Write computational notebooks 
===

**Computational notebooks** belong to the [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) approach that combines text and code in the same document.

In R, **computational notebooks = R Markdown** documents:
- narrative text in Markdown
- source code in R programming language 

Airbnb uses R Markdown to document all their analyses in R. See [Bion et al, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1392362): _How R Helps Airbnb Make the Most of its Data_


#2 Write computational notebooks
===
incremental:true

_Why must I create computational notebooks?_

- it captures your **entire analysis process** in one document
- it is **live document**  
- it can be rendered in **several output formats** (PDF, HTML)


#2 Write computational notebooks
===
incremental:true

_How can others take advantage of my computational notebooks?_

Other can **read**, **run** and **explore** them!

- you can support others **reading** your analysis (eg. attaching HTML/PDF version to your paper, publishing it in [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/))
- you can suport others **running** your notebooks in the cloud (eg. [Binder](https://mybinder.org/))
- you can suport other **exploring** your analysis by changing parameter (eg. sliders, dashboards)


#2 Write computational notebooks
===

How: 
- Add narrative text as normal Markdown syntax,
- Add code chunks using curly braces`{r` and `}`, and finally 
- Publish the HTML output in [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/)
