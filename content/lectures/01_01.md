Why focus on the process when the world is outcome driven? Don’t results matter? 

Yes, results do matter. 

But if you optimize for the outcome, you win one time. 

If you __optimize for a process that leads to great outcomes__, you can win again and again.</span>


The profession of the scientist
===

- Why are you a scientist/researcher?

- What are your motivations?


The profession of the scientist
===
incremental: true

__Intrinsic__ motivations:
- "locos por investigar"
- avance knowledge
- make a better world!

__Extrinsic__ motivations:
- financial incentives
- move up the career ladder
- recognition by peers, society

Reproducibility in Science
===

- Doubt is inherently human and we (scientists) always have doubts!
  - (Well, that doesn’t mean it’s OK to keep questioning climate change, evolution, and the power of vaccines...)

- Avancing science and knowledge requires:
  - __openness__,
  - __transparency__,
  - __reproduction__ and   
  - __cumulative evidence__ (reviews)

Boyle's [air-pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pump) was one of the first documented disputes over reproducibility...
-  Dutch scientist [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) reported an new effect he termed "anomalous suspension" in Amsterdam.
- [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle) in UK could not replicate this phenomenon in his own air pump.
- Huygens was invited to UK (1663) to personally help Boyle __replicate__ anomalous suspension of water.

No, it is not _new_, but it _is_ still a problem. 

In 2015, [1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)
- more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments
- more than 50% have failed to reproduce their own experiments

There is an extensive literature on the __reproducucibility crisis__:

- In scientific studies in general, across various disciplines. See [Ioannidis, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124): _Why most published research findings are false_

- In economics. See [Ioannidis, Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecoj.12461): _The Power of Bias in Economics Research_

- In medical chemistry. See [Baker, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/548485a): _Check your chemistry_

- In neuroscience. See [Button et al, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3475): _Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience_

Some argue there is not a such reproducibility crisis.

[Fanelli, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708272114): _Is science really facing a reproducibility crisis, and do we need it to?_

> The new “science is in crisis” narrative is not only empirically unsupported, but also quite obviously counterproductive. Instead of inspiring younger generations to do more and better science, it might foster in them cynicism and indifference. Instead of inviting greater respect for and investment in research, it risks discrediting the value of evidence and feeding antiscientific agendas.

The concept of reproduction 
===

Fundamental objectives of scientific research:
- Discover laws, axioms, rules, etc. and describe them and under which condition they apply
- Conduct case studies to prove a general principle (“proof-of-concept”)
- Transfer/publish results to prove validity, veracity, trust in findings

Are you a _rationalist_ or an _empiricist_? 

The concept of reproduction 
===

> One of the pathways by which scientists confirm the validity of a new
finding or discovery is by repeating the research that produced it.


> Observed inconsistency may be an important precursor to new discovery while 
others fear it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science


The concept of reproduction 
===

We define _reproducibility_ to mean __computational reproducibility__

* Computation has a large and increasing role in scientific research
  * X-informatics: bio-informatics, geo-informatics, ...
  * [The Transformation of the Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_rfujuRHUU)

*  If results are produced by complex computational processes, the methods section of a scientific paper is no longer sufficient.

__Re__{producible,plicable,create}: [Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162); [Donoho et al, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2009.15); [Peng, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1213847); [Barba, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03311): 

- __Reproducible research__: Authors provide all the necessary data and the computer codes to run
the analysis again, re-creating the results.

- __Replication__: A study that arrives at the same scientific findings as another study, collecting new
data (possibly with different methods) and completing new analyses.

If you read one article, read this one! [Leek & Jager, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-054104)

- __Reproducibility__: A study is reproducible if all of the code and data used to generate the numbers and figures in the paper are available and exactly produce the published results.

- __Replicability__: A study is replicable if an identical experiment can be performed like the first study and the statistical results are consistent.

- __False discovery__: A study is a false discovery if the result presented in the study produces the wrong answer to the question of interest.


The concept of reproduction

Our definition: [Ostermann & Granell, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12195); [Nüst et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5072)

> A reproducible paper ensures a reviewer or reader can recreate the computational workflow of a study or experiment, including the prerequisite knowledge and the computational environment. The former implies the scientific argument to be understandable and sound. The latter requires a detailed description of used software and data, and both being openly available.

![](figs/spectrumreproducibility.jpg)


The concept of (pre-)reproduction 
===

- "Science should be ‘show me’, not ‘trust me’; it should be ‘help me if you can’, not ‘catch me if you can’. 
- "If I publish an advertisement for my work (that is, a paper long on results but short on methods) and it’s wrong, that makes me untrustworthy. 
- "If I say: ‘here’s my work’ and it’s wrong, I might have erred, but at least I am honest".

Summary
===

Reproducibility is the easiest of these problems to define and assess. 

Computational reproducibility involves:
- checking the published manuscript, 
- looking for published data and code, then 
- comparing the results of that data and code to the published results. 

> If they are the same, the study is reproducible;
> otherwise, the study is not.


Summary 
===

Reproducibility involves the _original_ data and code.

Replicability involves _new_ data collection to test for consistency with previous results of a smiliar study.

> Even when paper is computationally reproducible, it may fail to be replicated

Discussion
===

Write a list of obstacles for reproducibility that potentially apply to your discipline. Examples:
- Complex instrumentation: high-performance computation facilities, etc.
- Nonpublic information: patient records, human subject data, etc.
- Complex data gathering: multiple sensors, models, etc
