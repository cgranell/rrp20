type: sub-section

Why focus on the process when the world is outcome driven? Don’t results matter? 

Yes, results do matter. 

But if you optimize for the outcome, you win one time. 

If you __optimize for a process that leads to great outcomes__, you can win again and again.</span>

The profession of the scientist
===

- Why are you a scientist/researcher?

- What are your motivations?

The profession of the scientist
===
incremental: true

__Intrinsic__ motivations:
- "locos por investigar"
- avance knowledge
- make a better world!

__Extrinsic__ motivations:
- financial incentives
- move up the career ladder
- recognition by peers, society

Reproducibility in Science
===

- Doubt is inherently human and we (scientists) always have doubts!
  - (that doesn’t mean it’s OK to keep questioning climate change, evolution, and the power of vaccines.)

- Avancing science and knowledge requires:
  - __open__,
  - __transparent__,
  - __reproducible__ and   
  - __cumulative__ research practices

Boyle's [air-pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pump) was one of the first documented disputes over reproducibility...
-  Dutch scientists [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) reported an effec he termed "anomalous suspension" in Amsterdam.
- [Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle) in UK could not replicate this phenomenon in his own air pump.
- Huygens was invited to England in 1663 to personally help Boyle replicate anomalous suspension of water.

[Robert Boyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle) (1627–1691)
  - a pioneer of the experimental method.
  - "By repeating the same experiment over and over again, the certainty of fact will emerge."

[Donald E Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) (1938-):
- [Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming): a new methodology of programming.
- In LP, a programme combines human language and code snippets."
- "Programs are meant to be read by humans, and only incidentally for computers to execute."

Electronic documents give reproducible research a new meaning ([Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162)):
- Executable digital notebook
- Be open + help others
- Document for future self

Reproducibility is a (not new) problem today
===

[1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) 2015
  - more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments
  - more than 50% have failed to reproduce their own experiments

Reproducibility today
===

Some argue there is not a reproducibility crisis.

[Opinion: Is science really facing a reproducibility crisis, and do we need it to?](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708272114)


But why is it a "crisis"? 
===

Fundamental objectives of scientific research:
- Discover laws, axioms, rules, etc. and describe them and under which condition they apply
- Case studies important to prove the general principle (“proof-of-concept”)
- Endless possibilities for case studies -> need to transfer results
- Validity, veracity, trust in findings


What does reproducibility mean... for a PhD thesis?
