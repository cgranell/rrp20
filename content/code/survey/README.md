# Likert scale survey 


## Introduction 
Participants were asked to fill in a survey at the start of the course. Here we generate some [likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) plots based on the `likert`r package for a sample of that survey.  

## Folder content 
- `data-raw` folder: an anomymised subset of the original survey answers.
- `data`folder: filtered survey to these terms: _Open access_, _Computational essays_, _Digital notebooks_, _Data repositories_, and _License_.
- `R` folder: scripts for data preparation and plot generation.
- `figs` folder: generated Likert scale plot.
