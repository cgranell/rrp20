# RRP - Preliminaries

You learned the concept of __reproduction__ and explored its interpretation in your discipline 

The idea of computational reproducibility is easy to understand:
- check the published manuscript to reproduce, 

- download associated data and code, 

- run the analytical stuff, and 

- compare the results to the published results.

# RRP - Preliminaries

Ok, I got it. But getting started is difficult!

Why?
- "I have never heard of reproducibility before"

- "I'm not good at using tools. _You said github?_"

- "I have never been trained"

- "I don't know where to find tutorials, guidelines..." 

- "I'm superbusy! I do not have enough time" 

- "I do theoretical stuff. Reproduction is not for me"

- ...

# RRP - Preliminaries

No matter your excuse, RRP are central to enabling transparent and honest science
- Reminder: _Don't fool yourself!_


So, the real questions are:
- How do I start to make my work more reproducible?

- What steps or recommendations can I follow?

# A simple reproducible project workflow

Inspired by British Ecological Society (BES), [guides to better science](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/guides-to/): [Reproducible code](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Reproducible-Code-2019.pdf) guide

It will serve us to:
- Discuss steps/recommendations

- Introduce tools as required 

- Adapt the steps to your realities

- Links to other papers, guides and resources

# Warnings before starting


There is NOT a unique path formula to make your work reproducible 
- Study examples and guides and **adapt** them to your workflow

Don't think about reproduction when the paper is ready to submit.
- **Plan early** and **integrate** reproducible practices from the start

Don't get stuck by the lack of skills in automated tools
- **Add tools increasingly** into your workflow as you get skilled 


---

# Summary

Goal is to **turn reproduction into a HABIT** 

- First get the habit, then get tool skills

- Plan early on your project

Goal is to do research in which **RRP are first-class citizen**

- Commonsense; maybe not all projects require reproduction

- RRP are a dynamic process. Adapt them as your projects change and your skills improve

- **RRP are for you**, then for others: _your future self will thank you!_
