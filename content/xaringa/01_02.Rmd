# Reproduciblity @ AGILE 

We're a group of enthusiasts on __Open Science__ and __Reproducibility Research Practices__ (RRP) in GIScience

GIScience = Geographic Information Science

Our web site: [Reproducible Research @ AGILE](https://o2r.info/reproducible-agile)
* List of activities done since 2017
* Access to resources created

`r Cite(my_refs, "granell2020")` describes our past activities and main achievements

# N端st et al. (2018): Analysis

Average reproducibility level: between 0 and 1 (poor)

# N端st et al. (2018): Survey authors

Main feedback from authors on why reproducibility was not increased:
- Legal restrictions
- Lack of time
- Lack of tools
- Lack of knowledge
- Lack of incentives

# Timeline: 2020

Paper out with our history: `r Cite(my_refs, "granell2020")`

AGILE 2020 & workshop _cancelled_
- 50% of full paper submissions provided reproducibility section anf resources (data, code)

Ongoing activities:
- analysis of papers published in past GIScience conferences 
- more education resources (like this course!)
- engage more people in the initiative
- formalise collaboration through project proposals
